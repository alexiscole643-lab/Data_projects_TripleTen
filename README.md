# Data_projects_TripleTen
Portfolio of completed projects I worked on while attending the BI Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.

| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 0 | Fresh Beats Insights & Recommendations | I created a stakeholder-ready report that summarizes key insights, evaluates Fresh Beats’ business challenges, and provides targeted recommendations to improve artist promotion, user engagement, and genre-based discovery. Using the provided dataset and visualizations, I selected the most relevant insights, connected them to business needs, and presented them clearly within the report template. |
| 1 | Manhattan Airbnb Pivot Tables | I analyzed Manhattan Airbnb data using pivot tables and cleaned datasets to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for vacation rentals, based on review frequency. I also calculated revenue for top-performing listings to guide investment recommendations and estimate annual earning potential. |
