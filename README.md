# Data_projects_TripleTen
Portfolio of completed projects I worked on while attending the BI Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.

| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 0 | Fresh Beats Insights & Recommendations | I created a stakeholder-ready report that summarizes key insights, evaluates Fresh Beats’ business challenges, and provides targeted recommendations to improve artist promotion, user engagement, and genre-based discovery. Using the provided dataset and visualizations, I selected the most relevant insights, connected them to business needs, and presented them clearly within the report template. |
| 1 | Manhattan Airbnb Pivot Tables | I analyzed Manhattan Airbnb data using pivot tables and cleaned datasets to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for vacation rentals, based on review frequency. I also calculated revenue for top-performing listings to guide investment recommendations and estimate annual earning potential. |
| 2 | VentureInsight SQL: Exploring Startup Trends |  At VentureInsight, I analyzed a newly acquired venture capital database to support insights for the quarterly investment report, performing tasks ranging from startup success evaluation to funding trends and influencer identification. My work included applying SQL to assess sector performance, acquisition patterns, global funding distribution, fund activity levels, and the relationship between employee education and startup outcomes. |
| 3 | E-Commerce Business Analytics | I analyzed raw e-commerce event logs and transformed them into actionable business metrics by building a conversion funnel, preparing data for cohort analysis, and calculating user retention across monthly cohorts. This project involved advanced spreadsheet techniques— including data cleaning, pivot tables, lookup functions, and cohort tracking— to deliver insights that help the company understand user behavior and improve website performance. |
| 4 | SuperStore Tableau | The Superstore dataset contains detailed sales, profit, returns, and product information used to evaluate business performance across categories, regions, and customer segments. In this project, I analyzed the data by creating visualizations that identify profit drivers, loss-makers, advertising opportunities, and return-rate patterns to guide strategic decisions and improve overall profitability. |
| 5 | SuperStore Abnormal Returns | I analyzed the Superstore dataset to uncover the key drivers behind the company’s high return rates by examining patterns across products, customers, geography, and time. Using Tableau, I developed visualizations, dashboards, and a narrative story that help leadership understand root causes and identify actionable strategies to reduce returns. |
| 6 | SHOPIFY Power BI | I analyzed the Shopify app ecosystem using Power BI to uncover the factors that drive app success, leveraging data across app details, categories, and user reviews. Through interactive dashboards and DAX-driven metrics, I evaluated review patterns, developer responsiveness, and category performance to generate insights that help identify high-performing apps and improvement opportunities. |
