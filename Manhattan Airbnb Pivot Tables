# 🏙️ Manhattan Airbnb Data Analysis

This project analyzes Manhattan Airbnb listings to help identify the most attractive neighborhoods and optimal property sizes for vacation rental investment. Using a combination of data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and revenue calculations, the project provides data-driven recommendations for property investors.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis was to evaluate Airbnb listing performance in Manhattan by examining:

- Neighborhood attractiveness based on **reviews in the last 12 months**
- Popular property sizes (studios, 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, etc.)
- Differences in property size preferences across neighborhoods
- Estimated monthly and annual revenue for top-performing listings

To accomplish this, I cleaned the dataset, standardized labels, created new calculated fields, and built pivot tables to uncover insights.
