# 📊 SuperStore Tableau Analysis

This project analyzes the Superstore dataset—containing detailed sales, profit, returns, and product information—to evaluate business performance across categories, regions, and customer segments. Using Tableau, I created visualizations that uncover profit drivers, identify loss-making products, highlight advertising opportunities, and analyze return-rate patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Identify major profit centers and loss-makers  
- Determine which products and subcategories the store should prioritize or discontinue  
- Evaluate high-ROI advertising opportunities across states and months  
- Analyze product and customer return rates  
- Provide visual insights to guide strategy and improve profitability

## 📊 Key Insights & Dashboards
### **1. Profit & Loss Analysis**
Visualizations explore:
- Top profit-generating combinations (subcategory + region, shipping mode + product ID)
- Largest loss-making products
- Three subcategories to promote and three to discontinue

### **2. Advertising ROI Evaluation**
- Identifies the top 3 state + month combinations for advertising  
- Includes average monthly profit trends  
- Uses a return-on-ad-spend (ROAS) rule: invest up to 1/5 of expected profit  

### **3. Returns Analysis**
- Calculates a binary return field (0 = not returned, 1 = returned)  
- Highlights products and customers with the highest return rates  
- Compares average profit vs. average return rate across selected dimensions
