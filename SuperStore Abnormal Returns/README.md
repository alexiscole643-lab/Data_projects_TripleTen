# SuperStore Abnormal Returns Analysis

This project explores the underlying causes of unusually high return rates in the Superstore dataset. By examining return patterns across product categories, customer behavior, geographic regions, and seasonal trends, I identified the key factors driving returns and created actionable insights for leadership.

## Project Overview
Using Tableau, I developed a series of visualizations, dashboards, and a structured data story that illustrate where and why returns are occurring. The analysis includes scatterplots, bar charts, geographic maps, and composite visuals that reveal correlations between sales, profitability, and return behavior. The final dashboard supports decision-making by enabling users to filter, explore, and identify root causes efficiently.

## Key Objectives
- Identify the primary drivers behind high return rates  
- Analyze return behavior across products, customers, geography, and time  
- Build interactive visual dashboards for leadership monitoring  
- Communicate findings through a clear and compelling Tableau Story  

## Deliverables
- Tableau worksheets analyzing return rate patterns  
- Three dashboard mock-ups and final dashboard implementation  
- Complete Tableau Story with narrative explanation  
- Final packaged workbook published on Tableau Public
